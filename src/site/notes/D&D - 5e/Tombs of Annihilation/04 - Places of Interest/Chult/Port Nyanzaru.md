"The familiar sounds of a harbor creaking rope, slapping waves, and heavy barrels rolling across the cobblestones mingle with voices shouting and cursing in an unfamiliar language filled with clicks, inhalations, and sing-songy words that make it sounds almost musical."

"The aroma of unfamiliar spices and tropical fruit mixes with the worst side smells of fish, tar, and carrion. "

"Beyond all that, the buildings are an explosion of color, painted in bright shades of blue, green, orange, and salmon. The walls are adorned with murals of giant reptiles and mythical heroes. Every building supports buildings and baskets and clay urns and color flowers, or is draped in leafy flowery vines."

"The whole city seems to bustling, sweating, laughing and singing."
